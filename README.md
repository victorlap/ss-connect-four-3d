Installation: 

If you plan on playing the game in Eclipse, you should download the following Eclipse Plugin `https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ansi-escape-console`

This plugin is used to represent the colour and shapes in the TUI. If you plan on playing the game through commandline or the terminal, this plugin is not needed. They already support the encoding used in the TUI.
